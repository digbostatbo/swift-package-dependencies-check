One of the main reasons why people use PDF format is because of its advantages over other file formats. Here are some of the benefits of using PDF files:

1. PDF files are secure. You can protect your PDF files with passwords, encryption, digital signatures, and watermarks to prevent unauthorized access, copying, editing, or printing. You can also restrict certain features or permissions for different users or groups[^1^] [^2^].
2. PDF files are consistent. No matter what device, operating system, or software you use to open a PDF file, it will look exactly the same as the original document. You don't have to worry about losing formatting, fonts, images, or layout when you share or print your PDF files[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
3. PDF files are compressed. PDF files can reduce the size of your documents without compromising the quality or content. This makes it easier and faster to upload, download, email, or store your PDF files. You can also compress your PDF files further by using tools like PDFCreator[^2^] or PDF Architect[^2^].
4. PDF files are versatile. You can create PDF files from any type of document, such as word, excel, powerpoint, images, web pages, etc. You can also convert PDF files to other formats, such as word, excel, powerpoint, etc. You can also merge, split, rotate, reorder, annotate, edit, sign, fill forms, and more with your PDF files using tools like PDFCreator[^2^] or PDF Architect[^2^].
5. PDF files are portable. You can easily view and share your PDF files on any device, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, e-readers, etc. You can also print your PDF files on any printer without losing quality or layout. You can also embed multimedia elements like audio, video, or hyperlinks in your PDF files to make them more interactive and engaging[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

As you can see, PDF files have many advantages that make them a popular and reliable choice for creating and sharing documents. However, there are also some disadvantages of using PDF files that you should be aware of. Here are some of the drawbacks of using PDF files:

- PDF files can be hard to edit. Although there are tools that allow you to edit your PDF files directly or convert them to other formats for editing, they may not always preserve the original formatting, fonts, images, or layout of your document. You may also lose some features or functionality when you edit or convert your PDF files[^4^] [^5^].
- PDF files can be large in size. Depending on the content and quality of your document, your PDF file may still be too large for some purposes or platforms. For example, some email providers have a limit on the size of attachments you can send or receive. Some websites may also have a limit on the size of files you can upload or download[^4^] [^5^].
- PDF files can be incompatible with some devices or software. Although most devices and software support PDF format nowadays, there may still be some exceptions that do not recognize or display your PDF file correctly. For example, some older devices or software may not support newer versions of PDF format or some features or elements in your PDF file[^4^] [^5^].

Therefore, before you use PDF format for your documents, you should consider the advantages and disadvantages of using it and choose the best option for your needs and preferences.
